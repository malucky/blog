I am in the middle of reading a book, [The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter](http://megjay.com/the-defining-decade/) by Meg Jay, and I came across a concept that I want to internalize. This is the idea of **identity capital**. The author defines this as

> our collection of personal assets â€” a repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time

This collection includes everything from job title to interests, and they are also how other people view us. For example, I might be known as that frontend guy, or that guy who loves basketball from New Jersey. These are how people will remember me (or not remember me), and this is also what sets me apart from the dozens of people I interact with every day.

The idea of a set of things that defines a person isn't novel. The emphasis comes in the fact that this list does not necessarily have to consist of things that go on a resume. These can be strong friendships, weak ties with acquaintances, hobbies, and the way one speaks. These things can be just as important as things like career and accolades.

Most importantly, **identity capital** is also how one views himself or herself. The question ultimately boils down to "who do I want to be?". Currently, I admit that I have a small set of **identity capital**; I don't make a distinct first impression nor do I leave a strong impression. After mulling over it for a while, here is a list of idenitty capital I want to amass:

- expert web engineer
- very fit athlete
- citizen of the world
- coherent and persuasive speaker
- philanthropist

As short term goals to accomplish the above, I've set out to do the following within one year:

- become an expert in Angular 2 and React
- visit 5 different states and two different countries I haven't been to
- become proficient in another language
- do two half-marathons
- do martial arts
- give three talks
- donate $100 a month to charity
- find and maintain a volunteering role
